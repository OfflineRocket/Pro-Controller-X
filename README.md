# Pro Controller X

### What is Pro Controller X

This is a (TBD if viable) project, attempting to make a Wii U Pro Controller, with the (important) features of a Switch Pro Controller. Taking inspiration from Xenoblade Chronicles X (sometimes called Xenoblade Chronicles Cross), it is an attempt to "cross" the two controllers into one Pro Controller.

### Why Make this?

Well, I haven't made it yet, but the inspiration is simple. I think the Switch Pro Controller has the best features, but the Wii U Pro Controller by far has the best ergonomics. I find the Wii U Pro Controller super comfy, and want to be able to use it in emulation. While using it on PC stock is an option with software, that adds input delay, and doesn't allow for any Gyro aiming, which is the main feature I want.

### Hardware

Planned Hardware:
- OEM Wii U Pro Controller shell and buttons
- 8Bitdo Lite 2 Controller as the brains
- Custom PCB to translate the 8Bitdo Lite 2 into the shape of the Wii U Pro Controller PCB

### Features
- Gyro Aim!!! (The reason for the project)
- Switch/PC Compatibility
- D-Input compatibility
- Vibration (TBD)

### TODO:
- ~~All Components Placed (90%-ish done)~~ All components should be placed
- ~~Traces Connected~~ Should be done (need to double check)
- Traces Routed (95% ish done, only a few left)
- ~~Finish Tracing from Scans (90%-ish done, mostly smaller inter-components not traced)~~ All components should be traced (need to double check)
- ~~Joystick PCBs (need special Resistors for normal Joysticks to work)~~ Done (resistors to be added to main board)
- ~~Antenna Tracing (needs to be accurate)~~ Antenna complete - impedance for pad needed
